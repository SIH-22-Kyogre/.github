### Project 1: SatVision: AI-Driven Detection of Non-Residential Built-Up Clusters from Satellite Images

The identification of non-residential built-up areas and detecting clusters of such regions can greatly aid strategic industrial
expansions, developmental planning, and understanding the earthâ€™s topography in general.

The proposed solution aims to achieve detection of non-residential built-up areas clusters through AI-driven analysis of Medium Resolution Satellite Imagery. 
In a systematic approach, the solution aims to,
- Prepare annotated datasets for using standard satellite imagery collected by NASA, ESA and ISRO.
- Utilize existing annotated datasets to support model building.
- Deep CNNs to detect, segment and identify clusters of non-residential built-up regions.
- Evaluate its performance on highly-populated regions like Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, and Delhi that pose a complex topography to detect patterns from. 
- We also leverage geographic metadata dn topological constraints to refine the solution formulation at multiple steps, including annotated dataset preparation and post-processing the Deep CNN results.
